Grading exercises manually
==========================

Unfortunately grading exercises manually is tedious work at the moment. When grading be sure that you take into account at least the latest submission.

To grade one exercise, open first the list of all submission as instructed below:

Then open each individiual submission or you can open bunch of them to own tabs:

One additional step needed:

From this view you can access stundet's submission, set their new points and optionally give them feedback. Plese note that currently studnets don√§t have access to their submissions because the A+ Exam is an own separate installation with limited access.
