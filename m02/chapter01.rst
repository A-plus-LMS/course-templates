Developing course material using reStructuredText (RST)
=======================================================

.. styled-topic::

  Main questions:
      How to utilize RST-tools

  Topics?
      bootstrap-styled-topic, admonition, ...

  What you are supposed to do?
      If you have already installed aplus-manual, these features
      should work just ok. However, there are also instructions
      how to utilize them in other courses.

  Difficulty:
      You might need to edit the course config files.

  Laboriousness:
      Installation might take a couple of hours.

In this chapter, we will take a look at different RST features, which allow you to develop course material.
We will focus mostly on custom RST directives, developed specifically for A+ course material.
The material will be compiled using `Sphinx`_, so all builtin Sphinx extensions are also available.

What is RST and why is it used on A+
------------------------------------

RST (ReStructured Text) is a human-friendly text file format.
Like HTML, it has markup for text formatting (headers, paragraphs, italics)
and hyperlinks. With some extensions, it can also include images, videos and
exercises. A software named Sphinx, which is originally made for documenting
Python software, is used to convert RST files automatically into HTML pages
showing in A+.

Here is a simple example of RST source code:

.. code-block:: none

    Heading
    =======

    Level 2 heading
    ---------------

    This is the first paragraph. It is tiny.

    This is the second paragraph. Note that paragraphs can span multiple
    lines, but they are still rendered as one block after compilation.
    *Italics* and **boldface** are produced this way.

    `This is a hyperlink <http://www.aalto.fi>`_ which becomes also a hyperlink
    in the final HTML version.

    Another level 2 heading
    -----------------------

    - also lists can be made
    - and they are very intuitive
    - notice the lack of markup compared to HTML

    Almost everything that exists in HTML can also be produced with RST.

There are many tutorials on how to write RST. Here are just some.

- http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html
- http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html

The benefits of writing course material in RST are:

- the RST code is much simpler than HTML
- the possibility to produce also LaTeX documents (PDF handouts) from the same source
- it is possible to write new "RST commands" (called Sphinx directives)
  for any kind of material
- resulting HTML pages are automatically interlinked
- one can use HTML templates to easily make many similar HTML pages
- of course, custom web page styling can still be used with CSS


A+ RST tools
------------
There are Sphinx extensions made for writing course material on A+. The
name of this extension collection is *A+ RST tools*. The rest of the document
concentrates on these.


Bootstrap-styled-topic
----------------------

The ``styled-topic`` feature seen above generates a description list wrapped in a ``div``-element with additional styling.

* Implementation: ``extensions/bootstrap_styled_topic.py``
* Styles: ``_static/course.css``


Adding custom RST directives
----------------------------

Custom RST directives can be added into the ``extensions`` directory.
New extensions should be also be added the name of the implementing Python module in the ``extensions`` list in the Sphinx configuration file ``conf.py``.
See for example ``bootstrap_styled_topic`` and ``div``.

Admonition with embedded MathJax-syntax
---------------------------------------

Builtin ``admonition`` directive is useful for defining new concepts:

.. admonition:: Algorithm
  :class: meta

  An *algorithm* is a finite sequence of unambiguous instructions, which
  each can be executed with finite amount of work and which together
  compute function

  :math:`f: I \to O`, where
  :math:`I` is the input set,
  :math:`O` is the output set,
  :math:`\forall i \in I`, the algorithm will stop in a way that
  :math:`o = f(i) \in O`

Math formulas are rendered with the `MathJax`_ JavaScript library.
Custom JavaScript can be added into the course layout template found in ``_templates/layout.html``.
This template extends the default A+ theme found in ``a-plus-rst-tools/theme/aplus/layout.html``.
