BYOC Exams
==========

School of Electrical Engineering has developed their own solution to host BYOC (Bring Your Own Computer) exams. They utilise custom linux image that heavily limits the features the student can use when in exam and limits network access to predefined addresses.

This solution is tested with A+ for ten students in semi-production environment but overall it's still in prototype phase. To use this system, it's required to collaborate the teacher behind this system Pasi Sarolahti
