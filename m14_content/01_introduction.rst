Introduction
============

Exam content will likely need adjustments when tranferring from traditional exams to electronical examinations. Based on our few pilots some observations have been made:

- Students try to improve their answers longer if they have interactive tools or feedback available. Fewer and / or shorter exercises may be needed.
- Getting assignments to run at all may take surprising long time. It's advisable not to make students write very long programns on their own.
- Grading partially correct programming assignments and essays is tedious. Grading partially correct answers might require development of better unit tests but likely manual work cannot completely avoided.
