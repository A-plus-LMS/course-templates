Rubyric
-------

Written personalized feedback can sometimes be more useful to students than
pure numerical grades, especially when talking about certain exercise types,
such as essays and bigger projects. Written feedback helps students to notice
what exactly is wrong with the answers and students can take the feedback into
consideration and use it to improve their answers next time.
Rubyric is an online tool which strives to make
giving written feedback easier and faster usingÂ 
`rubrics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric_(academic)>`_. Teachers can
create assessment rubrics which reviewers use as a base to review submissions.
Rubrics contain predefined assessment criteria, common feedback phrases and
corresponding grades and points. Reviewer chooses suitable phrases and can
freely edit the chosen phrases and add their own comments in between to create
feedback for students.

Rubyric allows you to do two different kinds of reviews, plain text reviews and
annotation reviews. Plain text reviews are constructed by putting chosen phrases
one after another and modifying the text. Annotation review allows the reviewer
to drag comments on the submission where they are shown. Annotation review
allows review to add comment on the exact place they want to comment on.

At the moment Rubyric cannot automatically configure a new course through LTI
so you need to manually create courses and exercises to Rubyric and then connect
them to A+. In following chapters we will discuss how to get started with
Rubyric, define rubrics and review assignments.
