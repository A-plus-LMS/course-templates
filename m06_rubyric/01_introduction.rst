Rubyric
-------

Written personalized feedback can sometimes be more useful to students than
pure numerical grades, especially when talking about certain exercise types,
such as essays and bigger projects. Written feedback helps students to notice
what exactly is wrong with the answers and students can take the feedback into
consideration and use it to improve their answers next time.
`Rubyric <https://rubyric.cs.hut.fi>`_ is an online tool which strives to make
giving written feedback easier and faster usingÂ 
`rubrics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric_(academic)>`_. Teachers can
create assessment rubrics which reviewers use as a base to review submissions.
Rubrics contain predefined assessment criteria, common feedback phrases and
corresponding grades and points. Reviewer chooses suitable phrases and can
freely edit the chosen phrases and add their own comments in between to create
feedback for students.

Rubyric allows you to do two different kinds of reviews, plain text reviews and
annotation reviews. Plain text reviews are constructed by putting chosen phrases
one after another and modifying the text. Annotation review allows the reviewer
to drag comments on the submission where they are shown. Annotation review
allows reviewer to add comment on the exact place they want to comment on.

Haka and LTI login
..................

It is possible to login to Rubyric through Haka login as well as login from
A+ with lti. In this manual we will be talking about lti configuration in
Rubyric every once in a while. Rubyric courses can be connected to A+ regardless
to login method. If you wish to use Rubyric without connecting it to A+ you can
ignore lti related parts and focus on general Rubyric instructions. In following
chapters we will discuss how to get started with Rubyric, define rubrics and
review assignments.

.. warning::

  At Rubyric the account you login with Haka login is not the same account you
  are using when you login through A+. Which means you might not have access to
  same courses with both login methods.
