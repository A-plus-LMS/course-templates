## A course template for A-plus learning environment

1. Download the template files.

2. Install Docker for Mac/Windows or docker-ce & docker-compose for Linux.
    * https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
    * https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

3. ./docker-compile.sh to compile RST files to HTML and YAML.

4. ./docker-up.sh to run A-plus system at http://localhost:8000
    * Available users are `root`:`root` and `student`:`student`.
    * The default course is created from the material.

5. Insert the course material in a new git repository for the course.
Keep editing and test in browser.

6. You should download new containers with `docker-compose pull` at least yearly.

Note! Docker downloads new container images when required. In this test system,
the first exercise assessment using new container image will produce a one time
error as the container order times out while downloading. However, the error
will disappear if you reload the submission page once the actual assessment has
completed.

For persistent A+ database and other storage, uncomment volume entries like
`./_data:...` in the `docker-commpose.yml`.

## Developing new assessment environments as containers

The exercise config can name any container in https://hub.docker.com/. We have
published few containers that support assessment for different environments at
https://hub.docker.com/u/apluslms/. Use the sample exercises in the course
template for reference to run assessment programs inside the containers.

The assessment container MUST register feedback by HTTP POST request to URI
$REC/container-post where $REC is an environment variable. The required request
fields are `points`, `max_points`, and `feedback` (HTML data). The provided base
container, https://github.com/A-plus-LMS/grading-base/tree/debian-stretch, has
convenience commands to capture feedback output from any programs and register
the result at end. Either build your custom container on hierarchy from our
base container or implement the HTTP POST interface yourself. Different
Dockerfiles and included scripts are a good reference.
